### Submission Instructions

#### Writeup
All solution writeups (math, plots, explanations) in this class must be submitted electronically as a .pdf file. Preferably this writeup will be produced using LaTeX or Word, but if your submission will be handwritten and scanned, please use a flatbed scanner or a scanning app on your phone (raw photos will not be accepted). Name your writeup `<your-sunet-id>.pdf` (e.g., `pavone.pdf`) and place it in the base level of this directory (i.e., at `.../AA274_HW2/pavone.pdf`). For now, this pdf may contain just your writeup for problems 1 and 2; you may extend this pdf when submitting problems 3, 4, and 5.

#### Submission
To download the submission script, open this directory (i.e., `.../AA274_HW2/`) in your terminal and run `git pull` at the command line. Then run `./submit_hw2_p12.sh` and follow the instructions to submit!
